            From my early experiences in product management, I discovered the thrill of bringing ideas to life, orchestrating teams, and delivering exceptional user experiences. As the years went by, I found myself discovering the realms of software development, where lines of code become the brushstrokes that bring ideas to life, immersing myself in stylesheets, perfecting layouts, and fine-tuning the smallest details to create seamless experiences and I find satisfaction in crafting robust backends that power the magic happening on the front end.
